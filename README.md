Pre-RegistrationWebsite
=======================

Project under [Dr Wadee](https://github.com/wadeehalabi) 

This system has do the following: 

1) Check the four year plan and the student transcipt and recommend a schedule for the next semester 
2) Assume all the courses are available
3) Keep track of how many students are registered in each course
4) Keep track of how many sections there are for each course

Your task till the end of this semster:

1) Download the four year plan 

2) Download your own transcript

3) Write down a set by step process to how YOU would create your proposed schedule for next semester using only the four year plan and your transcript. 

Ex. 

	 Compare each course in the four year plan with the courses in the transcript 
		If they are equal, consider that course as "Completed"


Etc. 

Try to come up with the solution with as little steps as possible. 

4) Do this at a larger scale with maybe ten students (Dr Wadee will give out multiple transcript for this)

Some things to consider: 

1) A lower limit for each section/course. Ex. 10
2) A higher limit for each section. Ex. 20
3) Maximum number of credits the student has to take
4) Minumum number of credts the student has to take
5) The previous courses the student has taken (from the transcript)
